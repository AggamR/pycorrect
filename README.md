# pycorrect
Text correction in python, accounting for similarity of the "typo" to actual predefined-words, and key proximity on the keyboard.
The function receives a word ("the typo"), and a bank of possible words. I originally intended for this to be used in an application launcher, but have since abandoned the idea.
